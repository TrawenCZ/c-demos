49:Now I only want you gone
44:
30:That’s what I’m counting on
20:Now little Caroline
10:
8:Under the circumstances
37:That would be funny
43:I’ll stop feeling so bad
24:So I could live forever
38:If it weren’t so sad
27:
3:Remember when you tried
15:Now I only want you gone
35:Goodbye, my only friend
18:She was a lot like you
52:Now I only want you gone...
25:It’s such a shame the same
39:
47:That’s what I’m counting on
12:You want your freedom? Take it
45:[Chorus 3]
7:Except I wasn’t laughing
41:I don’t need anyone now
51:Now I only want you gone
28:[Chorus 2]
46:Go make some new disaster
9:I’ve been shockingly nice
36:Oh, did you think I meant you?
26:Will never happen to you
22:
14:I used to want you dead, but
50:
2:It’s always such a pleasure
13:That’s what I’m counting on
48:You’re someone else’s problem
17:[Verse 2]
11:[Chorus 1]
5:
21:Is in here too
23:One day they woke me up
29:You’ve got your short, sad life left
16:
40:Well, you have been replaced
32:Now I only want you gone
19:(Maybe not quite as heavy)
34:[Verse 3]
4:To kill me twice?
1:Well, here we are again
6:Oh, how we laughed and laughed
33:
42:When I delete you, maybe
31:I’ll let you get right to it

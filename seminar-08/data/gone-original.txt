Well, here we are again
It’s always such a pleasure
Remember when you tried
To kill me twice?

Oh, how we laughed and laughed
Except I wasn’t laughing
Under the circumstances
I’ve been shockingly nice

[Chorus 1]
You want your freedom? Take it
That’s what I’m counting on
I used to want you dead, but
Now I only want you gone

[Verse 2]
She was a lot like you
(Maybe not quite as heavy)
Now little Caroline
Is in here too

One day they woke me up
So I could live forever
It’s such a shame the same
Will never happen to you

[Chorus 2]
You’ve got your short, sad life left
That’s what I’m counting on
I’ll let you get right to it
Now I only want you gone

[Verse 3]
Goodbye, my only friend
Oh, did you think I meant you?
That would be funny
If it weren’t so sad

Well, you have been replaced
I don’t need anyone now
When I delete you, maybe
I’ll stop feeling so bad

[Chorus 3]
Go make some new disaster
That’s what I’m counting on
You’re someone else’s problem
Now I only want you gone

Now I only want you gone
Now I only want you gone...
